# Education.Spring

## What is the project about?

Repository is for educational purpose - learning a Spring framework.
I am watching the [course][1] about Spring framework,
making some notes and adding them to the project, writing examples from the
videos and mastering my skill in this framework.

## What is the purpose of this project?

The **purpose** of the project is ***learning more*** about the framework,
how it should be used correctly to get the *most benefit*. As for me, I haven't got
almost any experience of using [Spring][2] and now want to try it instead of using
the [Servlet API][3] in web-applications.

In addition to, it is the first project, where I use the MarkDown language and make
description to the project. So, the skill in using MarkDown language is being acquired too.

## Getting Started

As there isn't a real or PET project, for viewing the all notes, which were made
during my study, you can switch between branches and see my notes, some examples
of code for each lesson.

### Prerequisites

For running some branches of the projects you need the next:

* [Tomcat 9.0.60](https://tomcat.apache.org/) - for running the Spring MVC application part.
* [Xmind](https://xmind.app/) - if you need to edit some my notes and then save it. Otherwise, you can see
  my notes in .png extension without any downloading additional program.

#### What things you need to install the software and how to install them

For running the code branches with Spring MVC you need install the Tomcat and configure it
in your idea. If you use the Intellij IDEA you can click on **Run** button and choose **Edit configuration**,
then add configuration for Tomcat server. Almost all configuration of app must be added
automatically, but check it before running. You can see
official [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThBw3WBTw9Q&ab_channel=IntelliJIDEAbyJetBrains).
After configuration, you can press run button of the server and go to browser to check the application work.
